# What is this?
This is my attempt at creating an application in WPF, that utilises the MVVM design pattern to allow CRUD operations on a MySql database table.
The project utilises Microsoft's Community MVVM Toolkit, to avoid immense amounts of boilerplate code.

## Why is this?
I am at a high enough skill level (not too great, but good enough!) where I am now comfortable to publish bits and bobs of code I create, for the purpose of showcasing my developing skillset.

## Can I use this?
Sure! Just note that I am still a newbie in college, where I started coding seriously from August 2022, only having taken some Python courses at the start of the year.
I would strongly advise against basing any project upon this, if it were to have any sort of real-world use.
Furthermore all comments are localised in Danish, but I tried to write the code as understandable as possible.

## Can I provide you feedback?
Absolutely, I would love some feedback on what I can improve! It is hard to improve without feedback.
